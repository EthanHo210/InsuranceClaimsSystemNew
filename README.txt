Welcome to our Insurance Claims System Program

With this applicaiton, users who submitted their claims or who recently jsut had a doctor's appointment would be able to view, edit, update and see their claims.

Our goal is to make a program that is not only user-friendly but also shows the capability of our knowledge in regards of coding with Java and FXML.

If you want to see the demo of this project, here are the links to the demo:

We would like to thank you for your support and we whole-heartedly would love your review on it
